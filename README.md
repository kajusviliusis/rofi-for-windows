# winLauncher
- an application launcher for Windows - inspired by Rofi, that I use on Linux.
- built with C# and WPF.

## Features
- App search/launch
- See recently launched apps

## Demo

## Getting started
- Clone the repository
- Open the project in your preferred C# IDE and build the solution.
- Launch the app (current hotkey is ctrl+space)

## Roadmap
(might implement this if I see its needed)
- [ ] Persist recent apps
- [ ] Settings panel (change theme, hotkey)
